        <li>When joining, Zenefits had a test suite of 13,000 tests - which grew to over 20,000 tests in the time I was there. The entire test suite would take well over 50 hours to run in its entirety. 
<br>
<br>My mission was to decrease the time necessary to create a full developer feedback loop. If a developer wants to test their branch, they should be able to merge into master in the shortest amount of time possible. 
<br>
<br>I developed an intelligent test planning service, dubbed "Gondor", which would devise a test plan based on data points about the branch to be tested. Some of these points of information were:
<br>
<br>- Code Coverage - look at the lines of code the branch touched, and compare them to a full coverage build of the test suite. If your branch touches a line of code shared with a test - run it. 
<br>
<br>- Modules - if your test is committed to a certain module, I'm more likely to run the entire test suite for that given module.
<br>
<br>- Test History - keeping close metrics of each individual test. If this test has never failed, does it have any value? Are we just asserting that 1 == 1? Maybe it's not worth running.
<br>
<br>- Failure combinations - does this test always fail when another, less expensive, test fails? If so, maybe just run the less expensive test. 
<br>
<br>- Test Runtime - does this test take ten minutes to run? Combining this with other factors might make us deem this test unnecessary to run.
<br>
<br>All of these factors were combined to add weights to each test for a given branch, and come up with a time-boxed test plan - a best guess for a test run which could allow us to safely merge to master. 
<br>
<br>The project was a huge success, Zenefits plans to open source it at some point, and I'm still on the hook to write a formal blog post about the whole thing :)</li>

      <ul>
      
        <li>Created a dummy web application, in Flask, containing page fixtures of every conceivable web quirk that might exist on a client site. Test Authors would write tests against these fixtures using page models.
<br>
<br>Some features: 
<br>
<br>- A "stage" which can be set via REST. Subsequent calls to that page would respond with the stage that was set on the previous REST call. 
<br>- Complicated forms which submit in all sorts of different ways. 
<br>- Completely customizable CSP headers, response codes, rendering modes, and more.</li>
      
        <li>Helped author an internal test framework - written in Python - which abstracted complex and tedious test authoring tasks into easy-to-consume libraries for test authors to use.</li>
      
        <li>Created entire internal reporting application to collect test results. This application was built in Python/Django and had a very complex five-tiered object model spanning over fifteen different models. Used Django REST Framework to make REST endpoints which test authors would post results to.</li>
      
        <li>"Automate the impossible" - creating tests to break countermeasures which are intended to fight bot traffic. This involves beating the very countermeasures the product is intended to protect against. (Sort of, internal debugging backdoors are often provided).</li>
      
        <li>For fun, created a "Lunch Bot" which would scrape weekly lunch menus and send daily notifications to the company with the daily lunch menu.</li>

This data was emergency-service-critical and the daemon needed to be rock solid. It never once went down.</li>
      
        <li>Developed an automatic update client run on the field by hundreds of ambulance which would query a web service to determine if a newer version of software was available. If a new package was available it would queue up the download using Microsoft's Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) API , which would trickle download the file based on limited internet availability on the field. When the download was complete, the tool would decrypt the archive and extract, then automatically restart the necessary modules. Every bit of this was done without any UI interaction - completely invisible to the user.</li>
